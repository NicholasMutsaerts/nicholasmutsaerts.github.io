# Welcome to my GitHub website

This repository serves as a centralized hub for my **System Administration portfolio** and a growing collection of **practical IT guides**. It is designed to showcase real-world experience, technical documentation, and hands-on solutions used in enterprise and small-to-medium IT environments.

### What You Will Find Here

### [Professional Portfolio](aboutme)
A detailed overview of projects, implementations, and operational experience demonstrating my work as a System Administrator, including **infrastructure management**, **endpoint administration**, and **Tier 2 support** responsibilities.

### [IT Help Desk Guides](it-guides.md)
Step-by-step documentation covering system administration tasks, troubleshooting procedures, configuration guides, and best practices across **Windows**, **macOS**, **Microsoft 365**, and related technologies. This site is continuously updated as I expand my documentation and refine my portfolio. Each section is maintained in its own Markdown page for clarity, version control, and ease of navigation.

#### Special Note:
- All guides are meant for **educational purposes**.  
- Use commands carefully; incorrect actions may cause data loss or service disruption.  
- Always back up important data and consult IT professionals if unsure.
