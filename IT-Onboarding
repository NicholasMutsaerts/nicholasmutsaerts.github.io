# Best Practices for Effective IT Onboarding: A Guide for New Hires

## Introduction
A well-structured IT onboarding process is crucial for new hires to quickly adjust to their new role and organization. When done correctly, onboarding lays the foundation for a strong employer-employee relationship, increasing employee engagement, reducing turnover, and contributing to business growth. However, poor onboarding procedures can have the opposite effect.

## Why is IT Onboarding Often Overlooked?
Several key factors contribute to the lack of effective IT onboarding for new hires:

- **Lack of Resources**: IT departments often prioritize ongoing support, system maintenance, and other pressing tasks over dedicating sufficient time for onboarding.  
- **Assumed Self-Learning**: Some organizations assume that new hires can quickly self-learn or adapt to the system and tools without formal onboarding, leading staff to feel unprepared from day one.  
- **Inadequate Planning**: Onboarding processes often lack dedicated time for IT training, leaving employees feeling overwhelmed and struggling to adjust.  
- **Budgetary Constraints**: Limited budgets can limit the allocation of resources and training for new hires.

- **Better Employee Retention**: A well-structured onboarding process helps new hires feel supported and prepared, reducing turnover rates.  
- **Higher Productivity**: By providing the necessary tools and training, employees are more likely to quickly adapt and become productive contributors.
