# Introduction

As a System Administrator experienced across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments, I have spent the past few years creating user-friendly guides to support new hires, help desk staff, and hobbyists exploring technology for the first time.

I am passionate about empowering users through clear guidance and technical training. Here, I am excited to share a consolidated version of those resources that brings together my previous LinkedIn posts and articles into one downloadable collection. 

Whether you are learning Windows 11, MacOs, Linux, Microsoft 365 administration, building virtual labs, or strengthening your foundational IT skills, I hope these guides become a helpful starting point on your journey.
